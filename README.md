# golox

*golox* is a **incomplete** [Go](https://golang.org) implementation of the Lox programming language designed by [Bob Nystrom](https://github.com/munificent) for the book [Crafting Interpreters](https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters).

I have taken the liberty of taking advantage of some Go features as I've seen fit. Therefore, this is not a direct translation.
